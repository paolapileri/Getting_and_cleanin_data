# Getting_and_cleanin_data
Final_assignment_coursera: GETTING AND CLEANING DATA COURSE PROJECT
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The task is to submit: 1) a tidy data set, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts.
Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The run_analysis.R contains the code that performs the folowing five functions on the given dataset 1.Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set. 2.Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3.Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 4.Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive activity names. 5.Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
